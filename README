User Authentication System - experiment branch
==========================
<tasks>
[ ] Needs cross browser support (apparently keyCode's differ in each browser).
[ ] maybe: replace bcrypt class with something easier to use with dreamhost.
[ ] Disable F-keys while typing in password fields.

[x] Remove account locking.
[x] Remove all email functionality.
[x] Remove account rest for now.
[x] Add hidden keyCode field.
</tasks>

==Experiment==
The goal is to create a key stroke level password that can be used to sign into 
accounts.

Most keys seem to work, still need to disable F-keys, and some others at least 
while in password field. Even distinguishes between number keys and key pad.

Has only been tested in Chrome. Still need refinement.
