Signin System
============
It's crude, still needs a lot of work. I'm uploading it so I can play with git.

==to do==
* Combine "check" files into one.
* test sending of email
* fix session cookie
* reset account function
* user account pages
* creation of admin accounts
* SQL statement for database setup and initial admin user



==Goals==
* Simple (at least from the user's perspective)
* Passwords not stored in plain text encrypted and salted.
* A way to protect against SQL injection.
* Admin adjustable lockable/recoverable accounts.
* Error tracking.
* User table generation.

==Things I find annoying from other login systems==
* No way to recover/reset password.
* Nothing to tell me if my username or password is wrong.
* Having to retype my username every time I try a new password.
* Login attempts set to 3.

===Password requirements===
So often I find my auto-generated KeePass password is more secure, but doesn't contain a special character or some crap, just let me use what I want. At most a website should only set a limit on how short a password is (not how long!).
