Signin System
============
==simple==

So far I like the simplicity of this, and would like to make it more functional.

* A way to add users.
* encryption not optional
* bcrypt encryption.
* user pages
* admin pages


==newer==
Arguably cruder than old and storing for reference.

==old==
It's a crude attempt of a signin system I'd like to rework one day. I'm storing this here for reference.

===to do===
* test sending of email
* reset account function
* user account pages
* creation of admin accounts
* SQL statement for database setup and initial admin user
* enable password encryption
** ''would be neat'': don't let users use a password from this list http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time
* real time username availability check
* real time password check (length, strength, not on list, match)


===Goals===
* Simple (at least from the user's perspective)
* Passwords not stored in plain text encrypted and salted.
* A way to protect against SQL injection.
* Admin adjustable lockable/recoverable accounts.
* Error tracking.


===Things I find annoying from other login systems===
* No way to recover/reset password.
* Nothing to tell me if my username or password is wrong.
* Having to retype my username every time I try a new password.
* Login attempts set to 3.

===Password requirements===
So often I find my auto-generated KeePass password is more secure, but doesn't contain a special character or some crap, just let me use what I want. At most a website should only set a limit on how short a password is (not how long!).
