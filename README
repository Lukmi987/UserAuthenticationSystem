Signin System
============

==Goals==
===Simple===
Being new to development, my code is simple. Part of the reason I'm doing this 
is to learn. Because this system meets my level of understanding it has to be 
simple.

===Secure===
Simple doesn't mean it can't be secure. Passwords are salted and hashed with 
a bcrypt class (credit and thanks to stackoverflow user Andrew Moore). Database 
inputs have been sanitized to the best of my understanding.

This is a far from flawless. There are still plenty of security measures that 
can be put in place.

===Expandable===
This project is intended to be the foundation for other projects.


==Tasks==
* Second table for expanded user info (name, preference, rights level, etc.).
* User Rights - Probably just two levels, user and admin. An open ended system 
for future expansion would be nice.
* Administrator Options - A place where administrators can change site wide 
options. Also where Administrators can promote users to admin.
* User Profiles - A place where users can update their own information.
* Email Verification
* Email Reset
* Install file that sets up MySQL tables.
* Real time email availability and password checks.


==Old Folder==
Previous crude attempts I keep around for reference.
