Login System
============
It's crude, still needs a lot of work. I'm uploading it so I can play with git.


==Goals==
* Simple (at least from the user's perspective)
* Passwords not stored in plain text encrypted and salted.
* A way to protect against SQL injection.
* Admin adjustable lockable/recoverable accounts.
* Error tracking.
* User table generation.

==Things I find annoying from other login systems==
* No way to recover/reset password.
* Nothing to tell me if my username or password is wrong.
* Having to retype my username every time I try a new password.
* Login attmpts set to 3.

===Password requirements===
So often I find my autogenerated KeePass pasword is more secure, but doesn't contain a special character or number or some crap, just let me use what I want. At most a website should only set a limit on how short a password is (not how long!).
